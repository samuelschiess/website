       <h1>Tuba Embouchure</h1>
           
        <p>Tuba embouchure follows much of the same concepts as any other brass instrument:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>“Say mmm-pah.”</li>
        <li>“Keep the throat open.”</li>
        <li>“Use the  “Aah” or “Oh” syllables while you play”</li>
        <li>“Lips should have firm corners, soft centers. Soft like butter left out too long.”</li>
        <li>“Faster air = high notes. Slower air = low notes. Don’t squeeze to play higher.”</li>
        <li>And etc.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>There are a few differences to keep in mind, however:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Tuba embouchure is much looser than any other brass instrument. Brass students are often told “firm corners, soft centers.” in terms of how to hold their lips. This is generally a good saying because firm implies much less tension than the word tight. But for some tuba students, they will still overthink the word firm, and use more tension than necessary. So watch out for that. Tubas should use just enough effort to hold a steady tone, and not much more. </li>
            <li>Tuba mouthpiece placement is much more variable than any other brass instrument. Trumpets are often told to place it 50/50 between lips, and french horns are often told ⅔ top lip ⅓ bottom lip. I would not recommend telling your tubas any specific ratio like that. Because the mouthpiece is so large, and because every student’s face is different, they will all have different ideal mouthpiece placements. The best placement is simply wherever the student has the best tone and the most flexibility.
        </ul>
        
        <p>Since tuba embouchure is so variable, I recommend focusing on air and sound more than the specifics of how their lips are held. After the general brass recommendations are applied, and proper air support is used, if a tuba player is trying to make a good tone, their own ears will direct them to their best embouchure. (See tuba $$$$$$$$$$$$$ for more information.)  Also, doing lots of lip slurs and mouthpiece sirens with beginners will help direct them to the most flexible mouthpiece placement. See this video for more info on how brass embouchures vary - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE1fn45b44c</p>
        
        <p>There are a few embouchure techniques you should definitely DISCOURAGE whenever they pop up. These are unhealthy mechanisms that will stunt their development, and include the following:</p>
        
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
            <li>The “smile” technique. This is when students pull the corners of their lips up and/or away from each other to reach higher notes. Not only is this going to cap their high range, it tends to create poor sounds. Have them watch in a mirror as they play so they see what’s happening and remind them that higher notes take faster air and a smaller lip opening. The corners of the lips may change in how firm they are, but they should never move.</li>
            <li>Exposing the wet, “shiny” parts of the lips. They will peek out of the corners of their embouchure. This simply is an indicator that they are not firming the corners the way they should, and maybe they are relying too much on pressure from the mouthpiece rim to create sound. Practice in front of a mirror and remind them to firm their corners. You may need to physically pull the tuba away from their face slightly as they play to help them not use too much pressure.</li>
        </ul>

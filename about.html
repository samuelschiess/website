            My name is Sam Schiess. 
            I have been learning computer science since 2021, starting with the Python language, and expanding to HTML, CSS, and javascript. 
            My interests in computer science started when I looked into pivoting my career away from Music Education. 
            Out of all the alternative fields I looked into, I enjoyed programming by far the most.
            Solving problems, being creative, and learning to do things that originally seemed out of my reach made programming exciting.
            Computer science is still exciting to me, and I am constantly trying to learn more. 
            Outside of computer science, I enjoy music, and am the band teacher at South Summit middle and high schools. 
            I also enjoy hiking. See some of my favorite trails below:
